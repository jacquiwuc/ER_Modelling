The core components of the ERD could be divided as followed:

1) Researcher – Authorship – Paper

2) Professor – Assignment – Project

3) Researcher – Employment/Position – School/Institution

4) Researcher –Qualification/Degree – School/Institution and Professor/Supervisor

5) Institution – School

6) Researcher is-a LabAssistant and Professor (or Researcher – ResearcherType) with an attribute to differentiate among the different rank of professorship (the suggested solution uses type attribute in Employment).

The alternative thinking as long as they are reasonable:

1) It is acceptable to have a currentPosition or position attribute for the Researcher

2) It is acceptable for School to be a strong entity set, which could affect the PK of School, Employment/Position and Qualification/Degree

3) It is acceptable if students do not rename the FK in the entity set if there is no conflict 4) It is ok if they opt for a ResearchType pattern instead of a specialization or superset/subset. The solution is not as good because LabAssistant and Professor do not share many of the relationships.
