# ER_Modelling

Scenario:

Modelling of a database that contains information on researchers, academic institutions, and collaborations among researchers in a graduate school.

Researchers: can be employed as either a professor or a lab assistant.

Professors: assistant, associate and full professors.

• For each researcher, his or her name, date of birth, and current position (if any).
• For each institution, its name, country, and inauguration year.
• For each institution, the names of its schools (e.g. School of Law, School of Business). A school belongs to exactly
one institution.
• An employment history, including information on all employment (start and end dates, position, and what
school).
• Information about co-authorships: i.e., which researchers have co-authored a research paper. The titles of
common research papers should also be stored.
• For each researcher, information on his or her highest degree (BSc, MSc or PhD), including who was the main
supervisor, and at what school. The supervisor must be a professor.
• For each professor, information on what research projects (title, start and end dates) he or she is involved in,
and the total amount of grant money for which he or she was the main applicant.
